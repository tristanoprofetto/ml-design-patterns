# Design Patterns in Python for Machine Learning Applications
### Overview
A guide to implementing design patterns in Python. Design patterns can be conceptualized as a template or cookie-cutter for tackling frequently recurring problems.
Each pattern is like a blueprint that can be customized to solve a particular design problem in your code.
In machine learning, design patterns are crucial for writing clean, manageable, and scalable code. They help in handling recurring problems such as model construction, data processing, and design flexibility.

What design patterns refer to:
* Objects: relationships between objects that can change at execution
* Classes: concerned with relationships betweeen classes and subclasses

### Why Design Patterns for Machine Learning Development?
ML projects often grow complex and unwieldly when it comes to code management...
Design Patterns provide a standardized approach to address common issues such as (but not limited to):
* Scalability: Adapting to increasing complexity and size of data and models.
* Reusibility: Allowing components of machine learning systems to be reused across different projects.\
* Flexibility: Making it easier to incorporate changes and new features.
* Maintainability: Ensuring the code is understandable and manageable.

### About Design Patterns
The purpose of design patterns ins to address the following levels of problems:
1. Creational: problems that arise during object creation level
2. Structural: problems specific to the composition of classes and objects
3. Behavioral: problems at the level of how classes and objects interact with eachother

### What we're looking at
This repo covers the following design pattern implementation:
* Abstract Factory: a creational pattern that lets you created objects that share common attributes without specifying their concrete classes
* Builder: a creational pattern that simplifies the creation of objects
* Observer: a behavioral pattern that allows a subscriber to register with and receive notifications from a provider
* Prototype: a creational pattern that provides a mechanism for copying the original objects to a new object and modify it according to our needs

| **Pattern** | **Level** | **Description** | **ML Use Case**|
|:---------:|:--------:|:---------------|:---------------|
|Abstract Factory|Creational|Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.|Useful in scenarios where a system needs to be independent of how its objects are created, composed, or represented. For example, creating different types of data preprocessors based on the data format.|
|Builder|Creational|Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.|Ideal for constructing complex machine learning models, where various components (like layers in neural networks) can be assembled in different configurations.|
|Observer|Behavioral|Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.|Useful for monitoring changes in model parameters or data, and for implementing callbacks to adjust learning rates, log metrics, etc.|
|Prototype|Creational|Creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype.|Useful for cloning machine learning models, especially in scenarios involving ensemble methods or transfer learning, where variations of a base model are required.|
